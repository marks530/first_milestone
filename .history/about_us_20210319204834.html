            <h4>About Us</h4>
            <p>With regards to UX, my overarching goal was to provide very simple website that the User can navigate easily whilst digesting the information that has been presented, in a smooth and efficient manner. I wanted to keep the design very simple,
                minimum text, easy to navigate, using some eye catching color (green, for example, is prominent and is often associated with eco-friendliness e.g. the [Green party](https://www.greenparty.ie/) or [Greenpeace](https://www.greenpeace.org/international/)
                ). I also use some photos that I took myself, which I found to be visually very stimulating, but without taking too much away from the content. This balance was surprisingly tricky to achieve at times but I feel I found it. My ideal user
                would be someone who is interested in learning more about the environment and would retain some of the facts and tips that I have laid out. I tried to keep the site uniform across platforms as to retain to its simplicity and responsiveness.
                To begin the process, I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to create simple wireframes to help me visual render my outline for the site. I used a mobile-first approach, again focusing on simple and efficient design where the user would
                naturally navigate through the different pages<br> With regards to UX, my overarching goal was to provide very simple website that the User can navigate easily whilst digesting the information that has been presented, in a smooth and efficient
