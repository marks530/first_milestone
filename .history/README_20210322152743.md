# **User Centric Front-End Development Milestone Project**

# Project Title:  *[Print Better  ](https://github.com/marks530/first_milestone)* - a webpage for better printing:

## Project Goals:

>The goal of this project is to create a website that identifies the possibilities of improving the quality of the output from a given printer and introduce the prospect of selling a solution. In the future we would like to use the contact details of the users who have signed up to contact them with product offerings such as printers and inks from our partners. I feel in the current situation that we are in with so many people working at home and working remotely that there is a huge opportunity attract customers with our proposals and once happy with our solution add future sales

## User Goals
The user of the site is somebody who is trying to get the best possible print quality from their printer. They may be an small business or home office or indeed a user who would like to print some family photos.

## User Stories
A good example is a solicitors office who would normally use a local print shop to print their letterheads and have one or more printers. The colour and detail of the letterhead is important and must be accurate and consistent. We are offering a solution for this issue.
With the current lockdown situation many more people are printing at home on low-cost printers that are sold to drive ink sales. They are generally set to use more ink than is necessary and by using our solution they could save money on ink and get better colour prints

## Site Owner Goals
The goal of the site owner is to attract consumers with prospect of high quality prints and to collect and store user details with a view to introduce other products and services in the future

## User Requirements and Expectations
Site users will be in a home, home office or commercial office situation using a printer with quality expectations. They will have experienced poor quality prints and understand the limitations of their current setup. Some will have heard of ICC profiles and want to learn more 

## Design Choices
Because we concerned largely with colour images and colour quality I have used a lot of images to intensify the user experience. I have decided to put a hero image on the landing page to show immediately the impact of our solution. The images of the specialized equipment that will further enhance this impression. The second service page further enhances the company reputation showing our relationships with the main printer manufacturers
The About Us page gives a short history of the company and the depth of experience of the company employees. I have also included a video of how to install an ICC profile on a Mac 

## Colours
I have used a range of images to deliver a colourful landing page of the website. I don't have a specific colour theme running through the website as I have deliberately used a lot of brightly images throughout. I have kept the sign-up buttons the same colour. 

## Fonts 
 I decided to stay with the recommended font families of Roboto and Exo. Even though I been aware of the effect of the use of fonts I am still learning how to apply fonts and use their styles
 

## Structure
### Landing Page
As the user arrives on the landing page they will see a hero image and a message with an introductory offer. The hero image is an image designed to convey the difference in colour achieved in different printing scenarios. The offer is an invitation to sign up to receive an ICC profile bundle.

This landing page is modelled on the Whiskey Drop site as I felt this was a well structured site
### Our Service page
This page is designed demonstrate the depth and breadth of the printers covered by the company. I created a page again with a hero image and several logos of our printer manufacturers partners. I have employed a gentle expand on hover effect to enhance the experience

### About Us Page
This page a little company history to generate an element of trust. I have included headshots of happy customers and their recommendations

### Contact Us Page
I created a page with a contact us form and modified to suit with a video element to help users to install an ICC profile

## Technologies Used
To build my website I have used:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap 4

## Testing

As I use an iMac initial testing was done on Google Chrome and subsequently I did test the pages on Firefox, Safari and Opera. Getting used to different dev-tools on different browsers was a good exercise. I use an iphone 6 myself so I often tested my site on this mobile format as well as on iPad and desktop. So I made sure to test substantially on as many browsers and mobile devices as I could, to ensure responsiveness and functionality of the site. 

On each page I evaluated the navbar, from Desktop to Mobile, watching the behaviour of the dropdown menu on each of the different screens. I also ensured the hamburger dropdown menu was working correctly and in position once it was visible on screen. 

Similarly for the footer element I observed its behaviour on the iPhone 6 and ipad devices as well as desktop views

Completed testing of all the html code at the following address [W3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea and the css.style file using the css checkbox on the same page

The validation process revealed some interesting problems. It discovered many issues which I had overlooked. I had inserted duplicate id elements instead of using class elements. I had also created section tags without using headers which came up as a yellow warning message.
I had also left in a "stray" video tag
Some of the code which I had copied from other sources such as [MDBootstrap](https://link) had obsolete attributes or elements such as the frameborder which I had discovered on [text](https://w3schools.com link). The solution was to remove the frameborder attribute and add an iframe element to the css.style file
The error message "Attribute type not allowed on element textarea at this point" occurred in the contact form I found at [text](https://mdbootstrap.com). This code was part contact form block so I deleted the <div> block it was contained in and added a new input message block instead




## Bugs

I used Balsamiq to create my wireframes and found it very versatile. I wanted show the wireframes in the Readme file and I thought it would be a good idea to save the file as a pdf as it was offered as an export to PDF option and all the pages could be in a single file. However this did not work out. It didn't work for multiple pages and neither for a single page. For some reason the pdf file extension did not work with the Github url for the file. I had to save all the pages individually as jpegs and add each one separately to the Readme file

A second problem I encountered was an unwanted element appearing on the home page and the service page. It was a tiny square element appearing to the side of the hero image on both pages. In Chrome Developer Tools the element was highlighted as li:: marker

I used Balsamiq to create all the wireframes for desktop tablet and smartphones

I found [css-tricks](https://css-tricks.com//) to be of great help with many useful code examples

The [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com//) website was full of useful articules and guides. The articule [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_zoom_hover.asp) I used to create the zoom-hover effect on the service.html page

To correctly size and format the embedded Youtube video on the "about_us.html" page, I found some helpful articles on [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_responsive_iframes.asp) and [on this site](https://blog.theodo.com/2018/01/responsive-iframes-css-trick/). I used a 16:9 aspect ratio as I felt it offered the best size from the users perspective.

The contact_us.html uses a contact form found at [](https://mdbootstrap.com/)
The style of the Customer quotes on the about_us.html page was based on the layout of the Whiskey Drop site
The Navigation Pane is based on the Resume Mini project and modified to suit


## Footnote
I been studying with the Code Institute for 3 months now and have thoroughly enjoyed the course. It has been a steep learning curve but a great experience. 
I have used the Slack resource and the many other free resources available on the web today and one feature has shone through loud and clear. That is a wonderful sense of camaraderie and willingness to help out others that exists between the coding community
I hope that as I learn and develop as a coder that I can contribute to the community and be part of the great sharing amongst those involved. There is hope yet for the human race!
